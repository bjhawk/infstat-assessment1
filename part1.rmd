Simulation of the Exponential Distribution
==========================================

First, our data. We will be looking at 10,000 means of 40 randomly generated variables
from an exponential distribution with a rate of .2:  

```{r generate.data}
lambda <- 0.2
nosim <- 10000
n <- 40

data <- apply(matrix(rexp(n*nosim, lambda), nosim), 1, mean)
```

Now we will look at a frequency chart. 
*NB* I'm going to include a few statistics all at once here and discuss them as the report progresses.

```{r plot.data}
# Plot our histogram and its density line.
hist(data, prob=T, breaks=nosim/250)
lines(density(data), lwd=2)

#plot the mean, and plot the expected mean of this distribution
abline(h=mean(data), lwd=2, col="blue")
abline(v=1/lambda, lwd=2, lty="dotted", col="red")
